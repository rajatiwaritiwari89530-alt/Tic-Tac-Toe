Tic-Tac-Toe (Tkinter)

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created with Python’s Tkinter library.
It’s a two-player game where Player X and Player O take turns to play on the same board.

What it does

Provides a clean and interactive graphical interface.

Lets two players play against each other.

Highlights the winning row/column/diagonal in green.

Shows a popup message announcing the winner.

Automatically closes the game once a player wins.

How to run

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Run the file using the command:

python tic_tac_toe.py


Player X will always start first.

Click on an empty box to place your symbol. The game will automatically switch turns between X and O.

As soon as there is a winner, you’ll see a message box and the game will end.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Tkinter (already included with Python, no need to install separately).

Note

This version closes the window after the winner is declared.
To play again, just run the script one more time.
